          <p><strong>Kevin Heuzey</strong> is an Israeli entrepreneur and the founder of <strong>Integrity.farm</strong>, a blockchain protocol that redefines Bitcoin mining through on-chain emulation — eliminating hardware dependency while enabling programmable, Bitcoin-backed rewards for Web3, gaming, and digital economies.</p>

          <p>In 2017, Kevin co-built central Europe’s largest Bitcoin mining facility at the time: a 2.5 MW Tier 4 infrastructure hosted on the <strong>Nokia Paris-Saclay</strong> campus, accelerated by <strong>Nokia Bell Labs Startup Program</strong>. That initiative led to the launch of the <strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong>, where Kevin explored the intersection of mining, energy reuse, and trustless architecture.</p>

          <p>Earlier that year, he co-founded <strong>Ethereum Garden</strong>, one of the first decentralized Ethereum mining networks in Eastern Europe, fully bootstrapped and launched in Odessa, Ukraine, just before the global GPU shortage. The project scaled rapidly and was later acquired by a Romanian family office.</p>

          <p>In 2016, Kevin participated in the <strong>Israel Tech Challenge</strong>, gaining exposure to AI, blockchain, and cybersecurity alongside former members of Unit 8200.</p>

          <p>Today, his work focuses on building verifiable, trustless infrastructure for decentralized finance — bridging real-world energy systems with transparent, on-chain incentives.</p>

          <p>Here, he writes about Web3 architecture, Bitcoin infrastructure, zero-knowledge systems, and how blockchain can evolve from speculation into utility.</p>
