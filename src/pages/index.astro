    <h1>Kevin Heuzey</h1>
    <h2>Blockchain Infrastructure Architect & Tech Entrepreneur</h2>

    <p>Kevin Heuzey is an Israeli tech entrepreneur, crypto infrastructure architect, and the founder of <a href="https://www.integrity.farm" target="_blank">Integrity.farm</a> — a blockchain protocol that redefines Bitcoin mining through on-chain emulation. By eliminating the need for physical hardware while leveraging real-time Bitcoin network data, Integrity.farm enables programmable, Bitcoin-backed incentives for Web3 platforms, gaming ecosystems, and decentralized economies.</p>

    <p>In 2015, Kevin launched Ethereum Garden, one of the earliest decentralized Ethereum mining networks in Eastern Europe. Built entirely from scratch in Odessa, Ukraine and fully bootstrapped, the project scaled rapidly to over 2,500 GPUs at a time when institutional capital had yet to enter the sector. It was profiled by Telegraf as “the boldest mining project in Eastern Europe,”<sup>[1]</sup> and was eventually acquired and transferred to a Ukrainian family office in late 2017.</p>

    <p>In 2016, Kevin was selected for the Israel Tech Challenge<sup>[2]</sup>, a government-backed program focused on AI, cybersecurity, and blockchain. Led by veterans of Israel’s elite intelligence unit Unit 8200<sup>[3]</sup>, the program deepened his technical foundations in decentralized systems and national-scale infrastructure protection.</p>

    <p>From 2017 onward, Kevin collaborated with cybersecurity experts in Eastern Europe, notably Volodymyr Taratushka<sup>[4]</sup>, co-founder of Hacken and the HackIT conference. He served as an advisor during HackIT’s transformation into a global Web3 security firm, contributing to early ecosystem strategies and architectural decisions related to blockchain-integrated cybersecurity. In the same year, he served as a jury member at the HackIT Cup<sup>[5]</sup> — a high-profile bug bounty and CTF competition sponsored by Fenbushi Capital<sup>[6]</sup> and attended by global figures such as Vitalik Buterin.</p>

    <p>In 2018, his thought leadership on blockchain-powered security systems continued through HackIT, with events featuring Phil Zimmermann (inventor of PGP)<sup>[7]</sup> and Steve Wozniak (Apple co-founder). Hacken, which emerged from this ecosystem, has since become one of the world’s most respected Web3 security firms, auditing over 1,200 projects including Binance, VeChain, Avalanche, KuCoin, and The Sandbox.</p>

    <p>In December 2017, Heuzey spearheaded the development of a 2.5 MW Tier 4 Bitcoin mining data center on the Nokia Paris-Saclay campus<sup>[8]</sup> — the largest in Central Europe at the time. Backed by the Nokia Bell Labs Startup Program, the facility served as the foundation for the Blockchain Research Institute, which he co-founded and directed until its closure in 2024. The institute focused on industrial-scale mining, energy reuse, and the convergence of physical infrastructure and cryptographic trust.</p>

    <p>In 2024, French deep-tech company Vistory became the seed investor in Integrity.farm and contributed to the development of its core protocol. Vistory, known for its flagship product MainChain<sup>[9]</sup>, specializes in sovereign cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and decentralized manufacturing systems, and collaborates with strategic institutions such as the French Ministry of the Armed Forces, Airbus, Dassault Aviation, MBDA, Naval Group, and the French Navy.</p>

    <p>Integrity.farm, Heuzey’s current venture, uses smart contracts, Chainlink oracles, and Merkle proofs to simulate real-time mining performance on-chain. It allows NFT collections, DAOs, and play-to-earn games to distribute wBTC-based incentives that track real Bitcoin mining economics without issuing inflationary tokens or operating physical machines. Each NFT minted on the protocol is collateralized and generates programmable rewards based on actual network difficulty, block rewards, and hashrate — creating an auditable, transparent, and decentralized incentive system.</p>

    <p>Today, Kevin focuses on designing verifiable, trustless financial infrastructure, bridging real-world energy systems with transparent, on-chain reward mechanisms. He also advises a European aerospace company on innovation at the intersection of autonomous systems, defense, and blockchain-based architectures.</p>

    <p>He writes frequently about Web3 architecture, Bitcoin mining economics, zero-knowledge systems, and the evolution of blockchain from speculative hype toward applied, measurable utility — across both digital and industrial domains.</p>
