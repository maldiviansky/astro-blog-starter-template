         <p><strong>Kevin Heuzey</strong> is an Israeli tech entrepreneur and the founder of <strong>Integrity.farm</strong>, a blockchain protocol that redefines Bitcoin mining through on-chain emulation—eliminating the need for physical hardware while enabling programmable, Bitcoin-backed incentives for Web3, gaming, and decentralized economies.</p>

<p>In <strong>2015</strong>, Kevin founded and served as CEO of <strong>Ethereum Garden</strong>, one of the earliest decentralized Ethereum mining networks in Eastern Europe. Fully bootstrapped and launched in Odessa, Ukraine, the project scaled rapidly—anticipating the global GPU shortage—and was acquired by a European family office in late 2017.</p>

<p>In <strong>2016</strong>, he participated in the <strong>Israel Tech Challenge</strong>, where he deepened his expertise in AI, blockchain, and cybersecurity, working alongside former members of <strong>Unit 8200</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong>June 2017</strong>, Kevin began collaborating with cybersecurity professionals in Eastern Europe, including <strong>Volodymyr Taratushka</strong>, co-founder of <strong>Hacken</strong> and director of the international cybersecurity conference <strong>HackIT</strong>. He served as an advisor during the launch of the Hacken ICO, which focused on building a security-first infrastructure for the Web3 ecosystem. This collaboration contributed to early interdisciplinary efforts at the intersection of blockchain, applied research, and data protection.</p>

<p><strong>Hacken</strong> has since become one of the most respected blockchain security firms globally, having audited over 1,200 projects, including <strong>Binance</strong>, <strong>Avalanche</strong>, <strong>VeChain</strong>, <strong>KuCoin</strong>, and <strong>The Sandbox</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong>December 2017</strong>, Kevin led the development of Central Europe’s largest Bitcoin mining facility at the time—a 2.5 MW Tier 4 infrastructure located on the <strong>Nokia Paris-Saclay</strong> campus. The project was supported by the <strong>Nokia Bell Labs Startup Program</strong> and gave rise to the <strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong>, where Kevin focused on the intersection of mining, energy reuse, and trustless systems. The institute operated until its closure in 2024.</p>

<p>In <strong>2024</strong>, <strong>Vistory</strong>, a French deep-tech company specializing in industrial cybersecurity, sovereign cloud infrastructure, and distributed manufacturing systems, became the seed investor in <strong>Integrity</strong> and built the core Integrity protocol and platform. Vistory’s flagship technology, <strong>MainChain</strong>, secures decentralized industrial workflows and protects sensitive intellectual property across critical European supply chains. The company works with major institutional partners including the <strong>French Ministry of the Armed Forces</strong>, <strong>Airbus</strong>, <strong>Dassault Aviation</strong>, <strong>MBDA</strong>, <strong>Naval Group</strong>, and the <strong>French Navy</strong>.</p>

<p>Today, Kevin focuses on building verifiable, trustless infrastructure for decentralized finance—bridging real-world energy systems with transparent, on-chain mechanisms. He also serves as a consultant to a European drone company, contributing to innovation at the intersection of aerospace, autonomy, and blockchain-secured technologies.</p>

<p>He writes about Web3 architecture, Bitcoin infrastructure, zero-knowledge systems, and how blockchain can evolve from speculation into applied, verifiable utility—spanning both digital and industrial domains.</p>
