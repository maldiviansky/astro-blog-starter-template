          <h2>Biography</h2>

          <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-heuzey/ target="_blank">Kevin Heuzey</a> is an Israeli tech entrepreneur and the founder of <a href="https://www.integrity.farm" target="_blank">Integrity.farm</a>, a blockchain protocol that redefines Bitcoin mining through <em>on-chain emulation</em>—eliminating the need for physical hardware while enabling programmable, Bitcoin-backed incentives for Web3 platforms, gaming ecosystems, and decentralized economies.</p>

          <p>In <strong>2015</strong>, Kevin launched <strong>Ethereum Garden</strong>, one of the earliest decentralized Ethereum mining networks in Eastern Europe. Bootstrapped entirely in <strong>Odessa, Ukraine</strong>, the project rapidly scaled—anticipating the global GPU shortage—and was acquired by a European family office in late 2017.</p>

          <p>In <strong>2016</strong>, he was selected to join the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/situation-gets-hackathoner-to-make-riot-warning-app/" target="_blank">Israel Tech Challenge</a>, where he deepened his expertise in <strong>AI, blockchain</strong>, and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, working alongside former members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank">Unit 8200</a>, Israel’s elite military intelligence unit.</p>

          <p>In <strong>2017</strong>, Kevin began collaborating with cybersecurity professionals in Eastern Europe, notably <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolodymyrt" target="_blank">Volodymyr Taratushka</a>, co-founder of the international cybersecurity conference <a href="https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/hackit-4-0-the-cyber-security-center-of-eastern-europe-is-emerging-in-kyiv/" target="_blank">HackIT</a>. He provided strategic guidance to HackIT before its evolution into <a href="https://hacken.io" target="_blank">Hacken</a>, contributing expertise in blockchain infrastructure, cybersecurity architecture, and decentralized trust systems. His advisory role focused on positioning the project within the Web3 security landscape and developing early ecosystem strategies—particularly those combining blockchain with cyber defense, ethical hacking, and digital transparency.</p>

          <p>That same year, Kevin served as a <strong>member of the jury</strong> at the <strong>HackIT Cup</strong>, a live bug bounty marathon and Capture the Flag (CTF) competition held during the HackIT conference in Kyiv. The event was supported by <a href="https://fenbushi.vc" target="_blank">Fenbushi Capital</a>, where <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo" target="_blank">Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin</a> served as an advisor, and drew global attention for its hands-on, security-first approach.</p>

          <p>In <strong>2018</strong>, Kevin continued his collaboration with the HackIT team as an advisor, contributing to thought leadership on the role of blockchain in next-generation cybersecurity and transparency systems. The 2018 edition featured high-profile participants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann" target="_blank">Phil Zimmermann</a> (inventor of <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/about/" target="_blank">PGP</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak" target="_blank">Steve Wozniak</a> (Apple co-founder), and focused on bridging the gap between cryptography, blockchain infrastructure, and real-world security applications.</p>

          <p><a href="https://hacken.io" target="_blank">Hacken</a>, which emerged from the HackIT ecosystem, has since become one of the world’s most respected blockchain security firms, having audited over <strong>1,200 projects</strong>, including <strong>Binance, Avalanche, VeChain, KuCoin</strong>, and <strong>The Sandbox</strong>.</p>

          <p>In <strong>December 2017</strong>, Kevin led the development of Central Europe’s largest Bitcoin mining facility at the time—a 2.5 MW Tier 4 data center built on the <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/" target="_blank">Nokia Paris-Saclay campus</a>. Backed by the <strong>Nokia Bell Labs Startup Program</strong>, the project gave rise to the <strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong>, which Kevin directed until its closure in 2024. The institute focused on industrial-scale mining, energy reuse, and trustless systems.</p>

          <p>In <strong>2024</strong>, the French deep-tech company <a href="https://www.vistory.com" target="_blank">Vistory</a> became the seed investor in Integrity and developed its core protocol. Specializing in industrial cybersecurity, sovereign cloud infrastructure, and distributed manufacturing systems, Vistory is known for its flagship product <a href="https://www.eurosatory.com/en/innovations/mainchain/" target="_blank">MainChain</></a>, which secures decentralized industrial workflows and protects sensitive intellectual property across critical European supply chains. Vistory works with major institutions such as the <strong>French Ministry of the Armed Forces</strong>, <strong>Airbus</strong>, <strong>Dassault Aviation</strong>, <strong>MBDA</strong>, <strong>Naval Group</strong>, and the <strong>French Navy</strong>.</p>

          <p>Today, Kevin focuses on building verifiable, trustless infrastructure for decentralized finance—bridging real-world energy systems with transparent, on-chain mechanisms. He also advises a European aerospace company, contributing to innovation at the intersection of autonomous systems, defense, and blockchain-secured technologies.</p>

          <p>He writes frequently about Web3 architecture, Bitcoin infrastructure, zero-knowledge systems, and how blockchain is evolving from speculation into applied, measurable utility—spanning both digital and industrial domains.</p>
