    <h1>Kevin Heuzey</h1>
    <p><strong>Kevin Heuzey</strong> is an Israeli tech entrepreneur and the founder of <a href="https://www.integrity.farm" target="_blank"><strong>Integrity.farm</strong></a>, a blockchain protocol that redefines Bitcoin mining through <em>on-chain emulation</em>—eliminating the need for physical hardware while enabling programmable, Bitcoin-backed incentives for Web3 platforms, gaming ecosystems, and decentralized economies.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2015</strong>, Kevin launched <strong>Ethereum Garden</strong></a>, one of the earliest decentralized Ethereum mining networks in Eastern Europe. Bootstrapped entirely in <strong>Odessa, Ukraine</strong>, the project rapidly scaled—anticipating the global GPU shortage—and was acquired by a European family office in late 2017.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2016</strong>, he was selected to join the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Tech_Challenge" target="_blank"></strong>Israel Tech Challenge</strong></a>, where he deepened his expertise in <strong>AI, blockchain</strong>, and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, working alongside former members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank"><strong>Unit 8200</strong>, Israel’s elite military intelligence unit.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2017</strong>, Kevin began collaborating with cybersecurity professionals in Eastern Europe, notably <strong>Volodymyr Taratushka</strong>, co-founder of the international cybersecurity conference <a href="https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/hackit-4-0-the-cyber-security-center-of-eastern-europe-is-emerging-in-kyiv/" target="_blank"><strong>HackIT</strong></a>. He provided <strong>strategic guidance to HackIT</strong> before its evolution into <a href="https://hacken.io" target="_blank"><strong>Hacken</strong></a>, contributing expertise in <strong>blockchain infrastructure</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity architecture</strong>, and <strong>decentralized trust systems</strong>. His advisory role focused on positioning the project within the Web3 security landscape and developing early ecosystem strategies—particularly those combining blockchain with cyber defense, ethical hacking, and digital transparency.</p>

    <p>That same year, Kevin served as a <strong>member of the jury</strong> at the <strong>HackIT Cup</strong>, a live bug bounty marathon and Capture the Flag (CTF) competition held during the HackIT conference in <strong>Kyiv, Ukraine</strong>. The event was supported by <a href="https://fenbushi.vc" target="_blank"><strong>Fenbushi Capital</strong></a>, where <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo" target="_blank"><strong>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin</strong></a> served as an advisor, and drew global attention for its hands-on, security-first approach.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2018</strong>, Kevin continued his collaboration with the HackIT team as an <strong>advisor</strong>, contributing to thought leadership on the role of blockchain in next-generation cybersecurity and transparency systems. The 2018 edition featured high-profile participants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann" target="_blank"><strong>Phil Zimmermann</strong></a> (inventor of <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/about/" target="_blank">PGP</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak" target="_blank"><strong>Steve Wozniak</strong></a> (Apple co-founder), and <strong>John McAfee</strong>, and focused on bridging the gap between cryptography, blockchain infrastructure, and real-world security applications.</p>

    <p><a href="https://hacken.io" target="_blank"><strong>Hacken</strong></a>, which emerged from the HackIT ecosystem, has since become one of the world’s most respected blockchain security firms, having audited over <strong>1,200 projects</strong>, including <strong>Binance, Avalanche, VeChain, KuCoin</strong>, and <strong>The Sandbox</strong>.</p>

    <p>In <strong>December 2017</strong>, Kevin led the development of <strong>Central Europe’s largest Bitcoin mining facility</strong> at the time—a <strong>2.5 MW Tier 4 data center</strong> built on the <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Nokia Paris-Saclay campus</strong></a>. Backed by the <strong>Nokia Bell Labs Startup Program</strong>, the project gave rise to the <strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong>, which Kevin directed until its closure in 2024. The institute focused on industrial-scale mining, energy reuse, and trustless systems.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2024</strong>, the French deep-tech company <a href="https://www.vistory.com" target="_blank"><strong>Vistory</strong></a> became the seed investor in Integrity and developed its core protocol. Specializing in <strong>industrial cybersecurity</strong>, <strong>sovereign cloud infrastructure</strong>, and <strong>distributed manufacturing systems</strong>, Vistory is known for its flagship product <strong>MainChain</strong>, which secures decentralized industrial workflows and protects sensitive intellectual property across critical European supply chains. Vistory works with major institutions such as the <strong>French Ministry of the Armed Forces</strong>, <strong>Airbus</strong>, <strong>Dassault Aviation</strong>, <strong>MBDA</strong>, <strong>Naval Group</strong>, and the <strong>French Navy</strong>.</p>

    <p>Today, Kevin focuses on building <strong>verifiable, trustless infrastructure</strong> for decentralized finance—bridging <strong>real-world energy systems</strong> with <strong>transparent, on-chain mechanisms</strong>. He also advises a <strong>European aerospace company</strong>, contributing to innovation at the intersection of <strong>autonomous systems</strong>, <strong>defense</strong>, and <strong>blockchain-secured technologies</strong>.</p>

    <p>He writes frequently about <strong>Web3 architecture</strong>, <strong>Bitcoin infrastructure</strong>, <strong>zero-knowledge systems</strong>, and how blockchain is evolving from speculation into <strong>applied, measurable utility</strong>—spanning both digital and industrial domains.</p>
