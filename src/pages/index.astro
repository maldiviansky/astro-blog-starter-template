          <p><strong>Kevin Heuzey</strong> is an Israeli entrepreneur and early pioneer in the cryptocurrency sector. He began building industrial-scale Bitcoin mining operations in Ukraine in 2015, and later, in 2017, led the development of what was then the largest Bitcoin mining facility in Europe. The project was hosted on the Nokia Paris-Saclay campus and supported by Nokia Bell Labs.</p>

          <p>In 2016, Kevin participated in the <strong>Israel Tech Challenge</strong>, a selective nonprofit program backed by the Israeli National Cyber Bureau and the Jewish Agency. The initiative connects global tech talent with Israel’s high-tech ecosystem through intensive training in cybersecurity, blockchain, and data science.</p>

          <p>As founder of the <strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong>, Kevin spearheaded research into sustainable crypto infrastructure. He developed <strong>BigBang Energy</strong>, a system that captured waste heat from Bitcoin miners using dielectric oil and converted it into thermal energy to power agricultural greenhouses. The project was presented in 2018 at the inaugural <strong>Monaco International Blockchain Conference</strong>.</p>

          <p>In 2024, following the conclusion of the Institute, Kevin quietly launched a new venture in the United States: <strong>Integrity.farm</strong>, after raising a pre-seed round of $1,000,000 from the French company <strong>Vistory</strong>. Vistory is a French technology firm specializing in secure, decentralized manufacturing solutions. Their flagship platform, MainChain, enables distributed production with traceability and intellectual property protection, serving sectors such as defense, aerospace, and medical devices.</p>
